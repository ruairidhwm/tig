# TIG

### (Totally Inferior Git)

## Description

A small project writing git in Javascript. I'm following the [Gitlet](http://gitlet.maryrosecook.com/docs/gitlet.html) example written by the very talented Mary Rose Cook.

This is mostly for me to understand the internals of git and try out some different code to what I normally write at work.

## Status

Unfinished. Currently I've written to:

- Initialise a repo
- Add files to a repo
- Remove files from a repo
- Commit files to the repo

## Example usage

```bash
$ tig init
$ tig add sample.js
$ tig commit -m "My first commit with tig."
[master 0711d1b2] My first commit with tig.
```
